## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Standards Based Student Work Portfolio
----
In an attempt to personalize learning for students in a co-constructive way, my application will be a place where 
students and teachers co-create learning goals.  Where each track and monitor progress and provide feedback.  Teachers 
create assignments that are aligned to state standards.  Students submit work and collect evidence of their learning in 
a portfolio.  The portfolio belongs to the student and it will move with the student from year to year and teacher to teacher. 
Teachers are able to tag assignments with standards and assess the student's learning for a given standard.  
Teachers also help students develop their next learning target/goal as they progress along the continuum.  Administrators 
will be able to create the proficiency scales to ensure equity.  A student's progress and the final portfolio can be 
shared with parents or college admissions.   
### Features
